# 2Pay
An simple app to control financial debts.

I was needing an app to control my debts, and was looking for a reason to learn Ionic, so I made this simple app.

Today, it uses the localStorage to save the "to pay" itens, as i didn't want to implement SQLite only for that.

Also, I do not want to pay $99,00 for publishing it on Apple Store neither $25,00 for publishing on the Play Store.


Please, feel free to change and upgrade this app! I would love it!
